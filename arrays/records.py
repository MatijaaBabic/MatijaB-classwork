#Records are basically lists of tuples, similar to a logbook or a table
#They have their rows and columns which are named, and data can be placed in the appropriate column
#They don't have to be ordered, because columns can be arranged in any way that we want, because we refer to it by it's name instead of it's position.

#def record:
#    Name: String
#    date : integer
#    timein : float
#    timeout: float
