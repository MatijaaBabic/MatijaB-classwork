 #print(tuple2[0])
 #print(list1[0])        #we can prove with this that square brackets don't differentiate a tuple and a list
 #to make a tuple of one item, we put a comma after the item.

#classic way of swapping values in a pseudocode
#a = 5
#b = 3
#print(a, b)
#temp = a
#a = b
#b = temp
#print(a,b)

# Python plebs can use a,b = b,a (because it's technically a tuple)
#Tuple is ordered, can hold multiple different types of values, static (size doesn't change while the program runs) and immutable (contents doesn't change while the program runs)
